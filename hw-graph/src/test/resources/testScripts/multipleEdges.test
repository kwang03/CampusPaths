#Tests the behavior of graph when there are multiple edges between two nodes

#Creates graph
CreateGraph myGraph

#Adds some nodes to the graph
AddNode myGraph n1

#Adds edges from n1 to n2 and lists children

ListChildren n1

AddEdge myGraph n1 n2 e2
ListChildren n1

AddEdge myGraph n1 n2 e3
ListChildren n1

AddEdge myGraph n1 n2 e4

#Checks that n2 has no children
