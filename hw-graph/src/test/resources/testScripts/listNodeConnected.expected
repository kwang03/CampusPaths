#Tests the functionality of listing nodes in a connected graph

#Creates graph
created graph myGraph

#Adds some nodes to the graph
added node n1 to myGraph
added node n2 to myGraph
added node n3 to myGraph
added node n4 to myGraph
added node n5 to myGraph

#Adds edges so that the graph is fully connected
