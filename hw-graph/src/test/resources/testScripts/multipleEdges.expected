#Tests the behavior of graph when there are multiple edges between two nodes

#Creates graph
created graph myGraph

#Adds some nodes to the graph
added node n1 to myGraph
added node n2 to myGraph

#Adds edges from n1 to n2 and lists children
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in myGraph
the children of n1 in myGraph are: n2(e1)

added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in myGraph
the children of n1 in myGraph are: n2(e1) n2(e2)

added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in myGraph
the children of n1 in myGraph are: n2(e1) n2(e2) n2(e3)

added edge e4 from n1 to n2 in myGraph
the children of n1 in myGraph are: n2(e1) n2(e2) n2(e3) n2(e4)

#Checks that n2 has no children
the children of n2 in myGraph are:
