#Tests the functionality of having bidirectional edges in our graph

#Create graph
created graph myGraph

#Adds some nodes to the graph
added node n1 to myGraph
added node n2 to myGraph
added node n3 to myGraph
added node n4 to myGraph

#Adds a bidirectional edge between two nodes with the same label
added edge e from n1 to n2 in myGraph
added edge e from n2 to n1 in myGraph
the children of n1 in myGraph are: n2(e)
the children of n2 in myGraph are: n1(e)

#Adds a bidirectional edge between two nodes with different labels
added edge e34 from n3 to n4 in myGraph
added edge e43 from n4 to n3 in myGraph
the children of n3 in myGraph are: n4(e34)
the children of n4 in myGraph are: n3(e43)
