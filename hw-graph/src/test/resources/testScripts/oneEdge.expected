#Tests the behavior of a graph with just one edge between two nodes

#Creates graph
created graph myGraph

#Adds nodes
added node n1 to myGraph
added node n2 to myGraph

#Adds edge
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in myGraph

#Lists children
the children of n1 in myGraph are: n2(e12)
the children of n2 in myGraph are:

#Lists Nodes
myGraph contains: n1 n2
