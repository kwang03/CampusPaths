#Tests Dijkstra's when the least cost path has one edge

created graph myGraph

added node A to myGraph
added node B to myGraph
added node C to myGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to C in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to B in myGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
