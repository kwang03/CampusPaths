created graph myGraph

added node A to myGraph
added node B to myGraph
added node C to myGraph
added node D to myGraph
added node E to myGraph
added node Z to myGraph

added edge 4.000 from A to B in myGraph
added edge 2.000 from A to C in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to B in myGraph
added edge 8.000 from C to D in myGraph
added edge 5.000 from B to D in myGraph
