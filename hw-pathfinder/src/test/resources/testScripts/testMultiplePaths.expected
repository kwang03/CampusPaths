#Tests Dijkstra's when there are multiple paths with same jumps away but different weight costs

created graph myGraph

added node A to myGraph
added node B to myGraph
added node C to myGraph
added node D to myGraph
added node E to myGraph

added edge 2.000 from A to B in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to C in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to D in myGraph
added edge 2.000 from B to E in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to E in myGraph
added edge 2.000 from D to E in myGraph

path from A to E:
A to C with weight 1.000
C to E with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
