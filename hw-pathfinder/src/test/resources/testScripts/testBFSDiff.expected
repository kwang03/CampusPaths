#Tests Dijkstra's when the path to be found is the longest in terms of jumps

created graph myGraph

added node A to myGraph
added node B to myGraph
added node C to myGraph
added node D to myGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in myGraph
added edge 10.000 from A to D in myGraph
added edge 5.000 from A to D in myGraph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
C to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
