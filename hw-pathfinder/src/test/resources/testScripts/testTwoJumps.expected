#Tests Dijkstra's when the least cost path has two edges

created graph myGraph

added node A to myGraph
added node B to myGraph
added node C to myGraph
added node D to myGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to D in myGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in myGraph
added edge 2.000 from D to C in myGraph

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
